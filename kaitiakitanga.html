        <div class = 'info'><p><span class="first-sentence">There are statutory definitions of kaitiakitanga.  However, unlike other terminology in environmental law, there is little case law or published best practice to guide practitioners in its application. The following description acknowledges the statutory definitions, but provides an understanding within a broader cultural context.</span>Kaitiakitanga is already acknowledge in legislation and is defined as follows:

 … the exercise of guardianship by the tangata whenua of an area in accordance with tikanga Māori in relation to natural and physical resources, and include the ethic of stewardship (section 2 RMA)

 … the exercise of guardianships; and, in relation to any fisheries resources, includes the ethic of stewardship based on the nature of the resources, as exercised by the appropriate tangata whenua in accordance with tikanga Māori (section 2, Fisheries Act 1992) </p></div>
